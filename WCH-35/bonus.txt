Fred and Bill were walking down the road when Pickle met them at the end of his driveway. "Come join us" said Fred. And so, Pickle joined Fred and Bill and the three of them continued down the road. 

After walking for almost five minutes in complete silence, Pickle finally had had enough. "Why isn't anyone saying anything?"

"Well", said Bill, "we weren't sure what to say. I mean, we couldn't continue the conversation we were having before you joined us."

"Yeah", said Fred, "that would spoil the surprise."
